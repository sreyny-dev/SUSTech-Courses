## Introduction
Why do we need CUDA?
GPUs are designed to perform high-speed parallel computations to display graphics such as games. Use available CUDA resources. It provides 30-100x speed-up over other microprocessors for some applications.
GPUs have very small Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) compared to the somewhat larger CPUs. This allows for many parallel calculations, such as calculating the color for each pixel on the screen, etc.
